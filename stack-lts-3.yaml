# One example in the integration test requires at least yesod-test-1.5.0.1.
# As of version 1.6.2, yesod-auth-hashdb requires yesod-auth-1.4.18, which in
# turn requires yesod-core-1.4.31, which needs blaze-markup-0.7.1 and
# cookie-0.4.2
# For lts-3 this can be forced by using an extra dep - specify this stack
# configuration in the .travis.yml ARGS.  (The example is disabled in lts-2
# because yesod-test-1.5.0.1 requires a newer yesod-core.)
